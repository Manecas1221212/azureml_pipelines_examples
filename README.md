Welcome to the official repo for the A Cloud Guru "DP-100 - Part 3" course. Here you will find resources to use alongside the videos and hands-on labs.

I hope that this content is useful both for those in the course as well as anyone else wanting to learn about data science in Azure.

Happy learning!
